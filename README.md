#Appointment app
This project has three components: Users, Appointments, and Doctor availability. The project has two users that are patients and doctors. 
This project shows how a patient can book an appointment, change an appointment, and indicate the condition by commenting on it.
The doctor can change the status from pending to do after seeing a patient. The app has a login page where one can log in if a user 
and a signup page if one is a new user. Under doctor's availability, a patient can check which doctor is available before booking an appointment.
